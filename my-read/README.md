# MyReads Project

MyReads is an web application that allow user to manage their books. There are three shelves (Currently Reading, Read, Want to Read) that uses can use to store their books. And these information are permanently saved on the backend, even they shut down the app and start again. In addition, there is a page for searching so that users can choose books they are interested in and put them in their own shelves. The searching result come from `https://reactnd-books-api.udacity.com` API.


## Quickstart

 ```npm install```
 
* start the development server with `npm start`


## API

* Using API from Udacity `https://reactnd-books-api.udacity.com`

The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)

### `getAll`

Method Signature:

```js
getAll()
```

* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update`

Method Signature:

```js
update(book, shelf)
```

* book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
* shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]  
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`

Method Signature:

```js
search(query)
```

* query: `<String>`
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of a maximum of 20 book objects.
* These books do not have `shelf` property. 

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
